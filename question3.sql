/* In Part B, you were required to update the carâ€™s row values with the latest received data. 
However, we lose the changes over time by doing this (For example, seeing the price change over time would be useful). 
So, instead of updating, you append newly received data into the tables. What changes would you make to the tables to make this method work? 
And, write a create statement for a SQL view that would show only the latest data for all cars (Hint: Window Functions).
